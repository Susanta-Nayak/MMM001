#### Gambler's Ruin
A gambler has a certain amount of money ("B") and is playing a game of chance with some win probability less than 1. Every time he wins, he raises his stake to a certain fraction, 1/N, of his bankroll, where N is a positive number. The gambler doesn't reduce his stake when he loses. Every time he wins, he'll raise his stake to  B/N, or his bankroll divided by N. When B=1000 dollars and N=4, for example, he'll gamble 250 dollars each time going forward. Should he win, he'll raise it again. Should he lose, he'll keep his stake at 250 dollars.

If he keeps at it, what are his expected winnings?

What should he recommend to his superiors?
